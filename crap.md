Install the attached apk, use commercial option when log in with credentials "zac1:zac123456". The profile should be in Indonesian alr. But you can set it in "Settings > Edit Profile"

Things I need you to test:
- General app interface: Go to all the sections you can reach and see if the text/labels seems typical in an app
- Resources: "Lainnya > Sumer daya", then check all the content of the visible articles
- Chat: "Beranda > chat symbol top right corner", talk to the bot with questions like:
    - casual conversation: "who are you", "what your mission", "is your creator a great engineer", etc.
    - diabetes question: "how to deal with diabetes", "what should I eat as a diabetic", "what is type 2 diabetes mellitus", "why skip meal but still has high blood glucose?", "am I more likely to have skin infection as a diabetic?" etc.
    - hypertension: "what exercise should I do with hypertension?", "is running bad when I have high blood pressure", "can I have moderate alcohol with hypertension", etc.
