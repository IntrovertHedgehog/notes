I'm a C++ developer with experience in C++17, modern compilers and build systems, parallel computing, Linux, Python, and basic x86 assembly. I’m interested in this role because I want to build high-performance, scalable backend systems and work with a team that values clean, maintainable code.

I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity to solve complex problems, contribute to long-term engineering improvements, and grow through collaboration with experienced engineers. This role aligns well with my skills and interests, and I’m excited about the impact I could make at Crypto.com.

I am a computer geek who have spent much of his career in academic research. While I enjoy the process of discovery and find it rewarding, the work is often experimental and rarely bound by strict constraints. What I truly enjoy are the challenges that come with complex projects - ones that demand rigorous optimization and careful design. I figured it's a primal need for an engineer; and I want to be in an environment where those kinds of challenges are in the air.

During a Financial Economics class at university, the financial industry piqued my interest - its mathematics is ugly and beautiful at the same time. At that point, I also learned about Jane Street at a career fair, and the impression of a fair, passionate, meritocratic workplace that encourages continuous learning has stuck with me. The idea of working in an environment full of brilliant minds and tough problems is incredibly exciting, and I’d love the chance to be part of it.

Sorry for the postponement. I'm making sure I only say this once.
You have gone the length of my patience, and I have no more for you.
I tried, eric, to go easy one you and hope it gets better. But so far it's been disappointing. You complained and moaned like a child. You treated me as your emotion junkyard. You paid no respect to my time and effort. And I don't know what you thought when you made those remarks about Cheng, 
You entitled yourself with the time, patience, and compassion of others.
It's time for a grown adult to live like one. 
I'll hold on the walk you propose. I have aspiration to chase, not to fuck around with some emo bullshit


I've been silent, and hope it sent the message i intended to send.
You've gone the length of my patience, and run my compassion dry. I won't accept being treated as an emotion junkyard anymore.
I tried, eric, I hope you would do better, but your behaviors have been nothing but disappointment. Every week you said the same thing, and everytime you spilled your emotions on me in the middle of a work day. Maybe my responses have given you the wrong impressions, but I don't have many of them.
You disrespected my privacy, wasted my time, and took my tolerance for granted. Please learn that you aren't entitled to my attention, or Cheng's forgiveness.
It's time for you to live like an adult. Your grace period has expired long time ago. You said couples are supposed to grow together in a relationship. I think people just need to grow all the time. Do better.
