I am a software engineer fresh out of university. During my time in school and my short career, I have dedicated immense time and effort to making my software run as fast as possible—to the point where nobody cared anymore. Optimization is my unhealthy obsession, one that has consumed more time than it has saved. Luckily, I hear this industry has some use for people like me. I hope you find me as perfect for this position as I do.

As a young and ambitious developer, with passion for writing high performance software and working on complex problems. I want to be in an environment where I can learn and grow alongside like-minded, talented people. The trading industry is where I aim to be, and Tower stands out with overwhelmingly positive feedback from its employees for their friendliness and engaging work. Being at the forefront of something so competitive and technically demanding is exciting—I know there will be plenty of stressful fun ahead.

I am a passionate C++ developer with a strong interest in high-performance systems, and complex problem-solving. I have theoretical and practical experience in C++17 standard and modern compilers/build systems, parallel computing, Linux, Python, and basic x86 assembly language. The chance to work alongside talented engineers, and build highly sophisticated systems really excite me as an opportunity to grow and excel as an engineer.
I believe I possess the skills and ambitious to be a great addition to Akuna Capital.


I am a passionate C++ developer with a strong interest in high-performance systems, and complex problem-solving. I have theoretical and practical experience in C++17 standard and modern compilers/build systems, parallel computing, socket programming, and Linux. I also possess professional experience with Java, JavaScript as a full-stack engineer at my current job. I did some game programming in C# and Unity during my time as an intern, albeit it being crude and short experience. I am excited to join your team of highly skilled and passionate programmers.

I'm a C++ developer with experience in C++17, modern compilers and build systems, parallel computing, Linux, Python, and basic x86 assembly. I’m interested in this role because I want to build high-performance, scalable backend systems and work with a team that values clean, maintainable code.

I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity to solve complex problems, contribute to long-term engineering improvements, and grow through collaboration with experienced engineers. This role aligns well with my skills and interests, and I’m excited about the impact I could make at Crypto.com.

I am a computer geek who have spent much of his career in academic research. While I enjoy the process of discovery and find it rewarding, the work is often experimental and rarely bound by strict constraints. What I truly enjoy are the challenges that come with complex projects - ones that demand rigorous optimization and careful design. I figured it's a primal need for an engineer; and I want to be in an environment where those kinds of challenges are in the air.

During a Financial Economics class at university, the financial industry piqued my interest - its mathematics is ugly and beautiful at the same time. At that point, I also learned about Jane Street at a career fair, and the impression of a fair, passionate, meritocratic workplace that encourages continuous learning has stuck with me. The idea of working in an environment full of brilliant minds and tough problems is incredibly exciting, and I’d love the chance to be part of it.
