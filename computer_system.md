CPU caches:
- L1 cache has low storage capacity but is usually the fastest memory in any computer, up to 100 times faster than RAM. Each processor core has its own L1 cache, usually around 64KB.
- L2 cache may be several times larger than L1 but is only about 25 times as fast as RAM. Like L1, each processor core has its own L2 cache. Each is commonly 256-512KB, sometimes as high as 1MB.
- L3 cache has the largest storage capacity, often 32MB or more, but might only be twice as fast as the system memory. L3 cache is commonly embedded in the CPU, but separate from the cores.
