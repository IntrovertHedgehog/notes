# computer vision
computer vision courses overview:
- penn's is more basic and focusing on fundamental, there's lower level technicality
- cs131 is topic based and segmented based on the techniques and usages. It's very heavy in technicality but never dive deep into it, likely to read lot of papers for in depth understanding
- hst582's course on bioimaging is math heavy and too specialised
- 6.801 - in depth fundamental leaning on how machine see things rather than processing or machine learning. This is a robotic course?
- 6.003 - signal processing
- 6.881 - representation and modeling for image processing, technical and structural approach to cv


fundametal: 6.003, penn, linear algebra, calculus. Mostly homework and complimentary papers. 
- calculus + 6.003

intermediate: cs131, 6.881, machine learning, AI stuff. Start building projects and contribution to public repo. Research a branch of cv for project development
specialised: hst582, go on as needed to penetrate a field


conclusion to multilingual app:
- target languages: engish, chinese, tamil, bahasa, malay, or variable languages. Prof want to extend to as many languages as possible, while maintaining relative good accuracy. Prioritise Asian languages
- Google translate has the greatest language bank, with many research supporting its performance: Tamil, indonesian, chinese and malay has supporting research for good accuracy
- method of implementations:
    1. app: generating translation files and ship with the app
    2. resources: the resources on the server can be requested with target language and translated on the spot, and get cached. Or the translation can be generated on update, and saved to the database
